The reason is that no arrivals data is provided in the data file for the airports LAX, SFO, ATL, MIA, or JFK. That is, there are no records showing these airport codes in the DestApt field. \n",

    "There are (not surprisingly) a couple of different ways you could have answers the departure parts of 1. and 2 for each of the five airports.  An easy way would be to extract the records for each airport from the larger data set, one at a time.  Then, for each one, determine the numbers of departures and arrivals (0, for these airports), the largest carriers, and so on.  Or, taking a somewhat more complex approach, you could loop over the data for the airports in some to generate the results for them.  A variation on this would be to write a couple of simple functions that you then applied to the data of reach of the airports."
