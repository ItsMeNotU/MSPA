Others discovered pandas.io.json.json_normalize(), which can work pretty well for many simple applications, and given that you don't mind having to fix up what can be some ugly column names.  Either approach, looping or json_normalize(), was fine for this assignment.\n",

    "Many of you used the .describe() method to get mean, min, and max. Note that this method produces a DataFrame that you can manipulate.  You can, for example, select results from it.\n",

    "Most of you who did the Extra Credit part provided a solution that would automatically read an arbitrary large number of json files and process them.  That the solution should entail automatic processing was at least implied by the assignment description, and it was mentioned in the Huddle.  Note that with a large enough number of hotel files the processing approach might need to take into account in memory processing limitations.  With enough files, it might be necessary to sequentially input, process, and write out to storage, the hotel data.\n"
