\section{1 Introduction}\label{introduction}

This assignment explores text from Enron email corpus, with the aim to
identify trends or anaomalies in employee communication or behaviour
using network visualization techniques.

\section{2 Data}\label{data}

The `original' Enron email corpus was uploaded by William Cohen from CMU
in March 2004 (Cohen 2015). This version of the corpus contains 517,431
distinct email from 151 users. The corpus does however have a number of
blank and duplicate emails as well as junk system data from email
transaction failures. Jitesh Shetty and Jafar Adibi from ISI later
uploaded a MySQL4 version of the corpus which attempted to fix those
problems. This version of the corpus retains only selected tables with
duplicate emails removed and names normalized, resulting in 252,759
emails from 151 users. For this exercise however, I have elected to use
a version of the corpus provided by Schulz, which is essentially a
MySQL5 version of the dataset provided by Shetty and Adibi, with some
additional data cleaning (Schulz 2015).

\section{3 Data Exploration}\label{data-exploration}

We are able to query the MySQL5 dataset for both a table of nodes and
edges. In this case, the nodes table contains information relevant to
specific Enron employees, including email address, last name and
employment status. A summary of the nodes table can be found in Appendix
A. The edges table on the other hand, contains records for email
communication between Enron employees, including the address the email
was sent from, address the email was sent to, whether the email was
directly sent, or whether the recipient was CC'd or BCC'd, and the date
at which the email transaction occured. A summary of the edges table can
also be found in Appendix A.

Using the table of nodes and edges, we are able to create an igraph
network which contains the (symbolic) edge list and edge/vertex
attributes. Using this network, we can create a histogram and cumulative
plot of the degree of each node. In this case, the degree represents the
number of emails sent to/from a particular employee. Figure B1 in
Appendix B shows a histogram of node degrees, whilst Figure B2 shows the
cumulative degree of each node. We can see that the majority of nodes
carry a degree of 1000 or less.

We can also use the same igraph package to create a network plot of each
node and their corresponding edges. We start by greating a network of
the Enron email dataset, without any filters or graphical overlays.
Figure B3 shows this unfiltered network. Clearly the lack of
categorization and limited use of graphical overlays makes it difficult
to make any inferences from this plot. Also note that this plot includes
three nodes which do not have a corresponding edge.

In order to improve the network plot, we add a filter to remove nodes
which have less than one degree, add a color overlay for each node to
represent the position of the employee, size each of the nodes according
to its degree (greater node sizes represent a greater degree), and
finally, include only emails which were sent directly to a recipient,
rather than all emails which were `CC'd' or `BCC'd'. Figure B4 shows
this filtered network. Again, it is difficult to make any inferences
from this network plot. However, it does seem that those with the status
`Vice President' tend to have larger node sizes (and therefore have a
greater degree).

To further simplify the network plot, we can be more aggressive with the
degree filter and exlude those nodes which have a degree less than 200.
We also color each edge according to its origin node. Figure B5 shows
this filtered network. Again, it is difficult to make any inferences
from this network plot, however it is slightly more obvious that those
with the status `Vice President' tend to have larger node sizes, and
that nodes with this status tend to email others with the same status.

In order to get an idea of how email communication at Enron changed over
time, we can create a separate network graph for emails over 2000, 2001
and 2002. Do note that the dataset has significantly more emails sent
over the year 2001. We retain the previously discussed filters for each
of these network graphs. For each year, we also create a circle network
plot in order to allow us to gain a better understanding of the
communication links between each node type. These plots are shown in
Figure B6 through to Figure B11. Unfortunately the spread of data makes
it difficult to draw comparisons between calendar years. An interesting
extension to this work may be to subset emails sent over the year 2001,
by quater, and to color only edges for one or two of the node types at a
time. This may provide greater insights into any observable shifts in
communication patterns for each node type over time.

To get a better idea of which individual nodes are most influential, we
can apply hub and authority scores as developed by Jon Kleinberg
(Kleinberg 1999). Nodes with a high hub score are expected to have a
large number of outgoing emails while nodes with a high authority score
are expected to have a large number of incoming emails. Figure B13 shows
the unfiltered network plot with nodes sized according to their hub
score. We can see a few nodes with a relatively large hub score and
Table A3 shows the nodes with the top five hub scores. Figure B14 shows
the unfiltered network plot with nodes sized according to their
authority score. We also see a similar amount of nodes with a relatively
high authority score and Table A4 shows the nodes with the fop five
authority scores.

\section{4 Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

We were able to process the dataset in order to derive a network plot of
emails at Enron. Although we applied a number of filtering techniques,
we found it difficult to extract any meaningful insights from the plots
themselves. It may be that these plots could be further improved on
through alternative categorizations or by making alternative subsets.
However at least for this assessment, the greatest insights were able to
be made by simply applying a hub/authority metric in order to find those
nodes with the greatest influence.
